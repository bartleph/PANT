(P)ortable (A)rduino (N)etwork (T)ool
  
Allows you to test the basic functionality of a network along with other tools.
  
This was designed on a Arduino Uno Ethernet board but should work on a regular Uno + Ethernet Shield.
  
The button circuit was modeled after tutorials from Adafruit:
  http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/lesson5.html
  
The current design uses a 16x2 LCD panel hooked to a I2C backpack. More info here:

The code is always a work in progress and is a real mess. Don't say you were never warned!

Features:

  Display network information
    IP Address
    Gateway
    DNS
    Subnet Mask
    MAC Address
  
  Test Network
    Ping Gateway, DNS, Resolve Host, Ping Internet Host or run all of the tests at once
    If running an individual test, it will loop until canceled using the Back button
    
  Host Discovery
    Calculate how many IP addresses it should be able to see, ping them, and displays report
    800ms timeout between pings and the ability to cancel the scan
    
  Port Scanner
    Allows you to enter an IP address to scan
    Scans ports 1 - 1024 (for now) and displays report
