  (P)ortable (A)rduino (N)etwork (T)ool
  
  Checks for the basic functionality of a working network. Tests DHCP assignment,
  ability to ping gateway and dns server, dns lookup, and ability to ping
  internet address.
  
  This was designed on a Arduino Uno Ethernet board but should work on a regular
  Uno + Ethernet Shield.
  
  The button circuit was modeled after tutorials from Adafruit:

  The current design uses a 16x2 LCD panel hooked to a I2C backpack. More info
